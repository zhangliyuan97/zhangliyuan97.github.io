> fzf is a searching tool in linux system, which can help you stop suffering the cd.

First of all, you need to use apt install the fzf package in your system. And it is very simple, just like:

```bash
sudo apt-get install fzf
```
And then, you can just type this in your terminal:
```bash
fzf
```
And then type some keywords of your target filenames.

For common use, I just set an alias in my ~/.bash_profile, like this:
```bash
alias fv='fzf $(fzf)'
```
So that, you can just type few words to open your file for editing without changing the directory. 

So just like I say before, it's very very convenient, is'not it?
