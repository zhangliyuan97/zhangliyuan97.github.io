## Quit vim with one-hand

This is a efficient one, because the user can quit vim even with just one-hand

- `ZQ` quit without saving, same like `:q!`
- `ZZ` save the content and quit, same like `:wq`
- `C-c` to do same operation like `<Esc>`

### Shifting screen

- current line to top, middle, bottom: zz vs zt vs zb
- scroll one line: ctrl + y and ctrl + e
- scroll half-page: ctrl + u and ctrl + d
- scroll full-page: ctrl + b and ctrl + f

### Within A Line

- begining of the Line: 0
- first char of the line: ^
- end of line: $
- last char on line: g\_

### Extra Fun

- move to a line by percent of line: 10%
- \* vs #
- word-wise navigation: e vs E, b vs B, w vs W
- don't be afraid to set marks: m vs M
- f vs t
- TRY % to jump between the left and right: {(lsakdjlfajljd)}

# Vim As your Editor - Horizontal

- using f for go to the charater that you want to be there.
  - using F for another direction
  - using t for front of the target
  - using , for Back the last one
  - using ; for Next one
- `\_` to the begining character of the line
- 0 to the begining of the line
- $ the the end of the line
- d $ will delete the content to the end of the line.
- Ctrl p or Ctrl n for complete the variable's name.
- I for jump to the begining of the line, but in insert mode.
- A for jump to the end, but in the insert mode.

# Vim Text Editor of Beginners Part 4 - Buffers

- [Video's link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDw0nqRfBts)
- :r put content from another files
- :e Open a buffer for editing, and this is a second buffer. And you can use this for a new buffer too
- :bp for previous buffer
- :bn for next buffer
- :enew for editing a new buffer, we can have multiple buffers
- :bd for delete the buffer
- :split filename will split the window and open the target file
- :vsplit filename or :vs filename, and you can open the same file and locate at the different section
- Ctrl w w, changing the window

# Using fzf in vim, That's really awesome!!! Because it's plugin-free!!!

```bash
function! FZF() abort
	let l:tempname = tempname()
	" fzf | awk '{ print $1":1:0" }' > file
	execute 'silent !fzf --multi ' . '| awk ''{ print $1":1:0" }'' > ' . fnameescape(l:tempname)
	try
		execute 'cfile ' . l:tempname
		redraw!
	finally
		call delete(l:tempname)
	endtry
endfunction

" :Files
command! Files call FZF()

" \ff
nnoremap <leader>ff :Files<cr>
```
