## Quit vim with one-hand

This is an efficient one, because the user can quit vim even with just one-hand.

- `ZQ` quit without saving, same like `:q!`
- `ZZ` save the content and quit, same like `:wq`
- `C-c` to do same operation like `<Esc>`

### Shifting screen

- current line to top, middle, bottom: `zz` vs `zt` vs `zb`
- scroll one line: `C-y` and `C-e`
- scroll half-page: `C-u` and `C-d`
- scroll full-page: `C-b` and `C-f`

### Within A Line

- begin of the Line: `0`
- first char of the line: `^`
- end of line: `$`
- last char in line: `g_`

### Extra Fun

- move to a line by percent of line: `10%`
- `\*` vs `#`
- word-wise navigation: `e` vs `E`, `b` vs `B`, `w` vs `W`
- don't be afraid to set marks: `m` vs `M`
- `f` vs `t`
- TRY `%` to jump between the left and right: {(lsakdjlfajljd)}

# Vim As your Editor - Horizontal

- Use `f` for go to the character that you want to be there.
  - `F` for another direction
  - `t` for front of the target
  - `,` for Back the last one
  - `;` for Next one
- `\_` to the beginning character of the line
- `0` to the beginning of the line
- `$` the end of the line
- `d $` will delete the content to the end of the line.
- `C-p` or `C-n` for complete the variable's name.
- `I` for jump to the beginning of the line, but in insert mode.
- `A` for jump to the end, but in the insert mode.

# Vim Text Editor of Beginners Part 4 - Buffers

- [Video's link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDw0nqRfBts)
- `:r` put content from another files
- `:e` Open a buffer for editing, and this is a second buffer. And you can use this for a new buffer too
- `:bp` for previous buffer
- `:bn` for next buffer
- `:enew` for editing a new buffer, we can have multiple buffers
- `:bd` to delete the buffer
- `:split` filename will split the window and open the target file
- `:vsplit` filename or :vs filename, and you can open the same file and locate at the different section
- `C-w w` changing the window

# Using fzf in vim, That's really awesome!!! Because it's plugin-free!!!

```bash
function! FZF() abort
	let l:tempname = tempname()
	" fzf | awk '{ print $1":1:0" }' > file
	execute 'silent !fzf --multi ' . '| awk ''{ print $1":1:0" }'' > ' . fnameescape(l:tempname)
	try
		execute 'cfile ' . l:tempname
		redraw!
	finally
		call delete(l:tempname)
	endtry
endfunction

" :Files
command! Files call FZF()

" \ff
nnoremap <leader>ff :Files<cr>
```
