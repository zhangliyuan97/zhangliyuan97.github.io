### Shifting screen
* current line to top, middle, bottom: zz vs zt vs zb
* scroll one line: ctrl + y and ctrl + e
* scroll half-page: ctrl + u and ctrl + d
* scroll full-page: ctrl + b and ctrl + f

### Within A Line
* begining of the Line: 0
* first char of the line: ^

### Extra Fun

* \* vs #
* word-wise navigation: e vs E, b vs B, w vs W
