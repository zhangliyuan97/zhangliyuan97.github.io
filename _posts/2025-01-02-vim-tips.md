## Quit vim with one-hand

This is an efficient one, because the user can quit vim even with just one-hand.

- `ZQ` quit without saving, same like `:q!`
- `ZZ` save the content and quit, same like `:wq`
- `C-c` to do same operation like `<Esc>`

### Shifting screen

- current line to top, middle, bottom: `zz` vs `zt` vs `zb`
- scroll one line: `C-y` and `C-e`
- scroll half-page: `C-u` and `C-d`
- scroll full-page: `C-b` and `C-f`

### Within A Line

- begin of the Line: `0`
- first char of the line: `^`
- end of line: `$`
- last char in line: `g_`

### Extra Fun

- move to a line by percent of line: `10%`
- `\*` vs `#`
- word-wise navigation: `e` vs `E`, `b` vs `B`, `w` vs `W`
- don't be afraid to set marks: `m` vs `M`
- `f` vs `t`
- TRY `%` to jump between the left and right: {(lsakdjlfajljd)}

# Vim As your Editor - Horizontal

- Use `f` for go to the character that you want to be there.
  - `F` for another direction
  - `t` for front of the target
  - `,` for Back the last one
  - `;` for Next one
- `\_` to the beginning character of the line
- `0` to the beginning of the line
- `$` the end of the line
- `d $` will delete the content to the end of the line.
- `C-p` or `C-n` for complete the variable's name.
- `I` for jump to the beginning of the line, but in insert mode.
- `A` for jump to the end, but in the insert mode.

# Vim Text Editor of Beginners Part 4 - Buffers

- [Video's link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDw0nqRfBts)
- `:r` put content from another files
- `:e` Open a buffer for editing, and this is a second buffer. And you can use this for a new buffer too
- `:bp` for previous buffer
- `:bn` for next buffer
- `:enew` for editing a new buffer, we can have multiple buffers
- `:bd` to delete the buffer
- `:split` filename will split the window and open the target file
- `:vsplit` filename or :vs filename, and you can open the same file and locate at the different section
- `C-w w` changing the window

# Using fzf in vim, That's really awesome!!! Because it's plugin-free!!!

```bash
function! FZF() abort
	let l:tempname = tempname()
	" fzf | awk '{ print $1":1:0" }' > file
	execute 'silent !fzf --multi ' . '| awk ''{ print $1":1:0" }'' > ' . fnameescape(l:tempname)
	try
		execute 'cfile ' . l:tempname
		redraw!
	finally
		call delete(l:tempname)
	endtry
endfunction

" :Files
command! Files call FZF()

" \ff
nnoremap <leader>ff :Files<cr>
```

# General Commands  

1. **Remove Trailing Whitespace**  
   - **`:%s/\s\+$//`**: Removes trailing whitespace from all lines.  
   - **Shortcut**: Use `:x` (with autocmd) to save and automatically clean up whitespace.  

2. **Quickly Join Lines**  
   - **`J`**: Joins the current line with the next, adjusting spaces automatically.  
   - **Batch Join**: Use a count like `5J` to join the current line with the next 4 lines.  

3. **Efficient Search and Replace**  
   - **`:%s/foo/bar/g`**: Replace all occurrences of `foo` with `bar` in the file.  
   - **`:%s/foo/bar/gc`**: Replace with confirmation for each match.  

4. **Indent/Unindent Blocks**  
   - **`>>` / `<<`**: Indent or unindent the current line.  
   - **Visual Mode**: Select multiple lines with `V` and press `>` or `<` to adjust them.  

5. **Repeat Commands**  
   - **`.`**: Repeats the last action.  
   - **Pro Tip**: Combine with counts, e.g., `3.` repeats the last action 3 times.  

6. **Cursor Movement**  
   - **`^`**: Move to the first non-blank character of the current line.  
   - **`g;` / `g,`**: Jump between the last edited positions.  
   - **`''`**: Return to the previous cursor position.  

7. **Delete Up to a Specific Character**

   - **`dfx`**: Deletes up to and including the character `x`.  

8. **Edit Inside Surrounding Text**  
   - **`ci'` / `ci"`**: Change content inside single or double quotes.  
   - **`ci(` / `ci{` / `ci[`**: Change content inside parentheses, braces, or brackets.  

9. **Jump to Matching Bracket**  
   - **`%`**: Jump between matching pairs of parentheses, braces, or brackets.  

10. **Insert Repeated Text**  
    - **Macros**: Record with `q[a-z]` and stop with `q`. Replay with `@[a-z]` or use counts like `10@a`.

      - Example: `:bufdo %s/foo/bar/g | w` replaces `foo` with `bar` in all files and saves them.
